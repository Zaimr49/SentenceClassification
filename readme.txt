# Embeddings and Sentence Classification Project 📚

## Introduction 🌟

This project explores the concept of **Embeddings** and their application in **Sentence Classification** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Embeddings help represent words, sentences, or tokens as vectors which can be used in various NLP tasks such as Text Generation, Machine Translation, and Sentence Classification. By the end of this project, you will gain insights into the power of embeddings and their practical use in classifying sentences from social media.

## Objective 🎯

- Understand the concepts of Embeddings and Vector Similarity.
- Use pre-trained Embeddings for Sentence Classification.

## Tools and Libraries Used 🔧

- `Python`
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `nltk`
- `gensim`
- `PyTorch`
- `scikit-learn`
- `gensim.downloader` for loading pre-trained models
- `gpt4all` for accessing large language model embeddings

## Dataset 📁

The dataset used in this project consists of tweets that are labeled based on whether they relate to real disasters or not. This classification can be particularly useful for disaster relief efforts by monitoring social media.

## Project Walkthrough 🚶

### 1. Exploring Embeddings

Embeddings are dense vector representations of tokens in natural language, having semantic meanings that reflect the relationships between entities in text. In this part, we use the pre-trained Word2Vec model to understand how words can be transformed into numerical vectors that machines can understand.

**Key Steps**:
- Load the pre-trained Word2Vec model.
- Create an embedding layer using PyTorch.
- Explore vector representations and compute vector similarities using Cosine Similarity.

### 2. Sentence Classification with Sentence Embeddings

We apply the concept of embeddings to classify sentences from tweets. The use of Sentence-BERT through the `gpt4all` library allows us to generate high-quality sentence embeddings.

**Key Steps**:
- Clean and preprocess the text data by removing URLs, punctuation, and stopwords.
- Split data into training and validation sets.
- Generate sentence embeddings using the `gpt4all.Embed4All` class.
- Build a classifier (Logistic Regression) to classify whether tweets are about real disasters.
- Evaluate the model on validation data and predict on new sentences.

## Results 📈

The Logistic Regression model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 0.8, demonstrating the effectiveness of sentence embeddings in classification tasks.

## Conclusion 🌍

This project illustrates the power and utility of pre-trained embeddings in NLP. By using embeddings, we can transform text into a format that allows for the application of standard machine learning techniques, enabling efficient and effective sentence classification.

## How to Run 🏃

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to follow the steps and code along with the project.

## Future Work 🔮

- Experiment with different models like SVM or Neural Networks for potentially better performance.
- Explore the impact of different preprocessing techniques on the quality of embeddings.
