    "\n",
    "Embeddings are a way to represent words (or more generally, *tokens*) as vectors. These vectors are useful for many tasks in NLP, including but not limited to: Text Generation, Machine Translation, and Sentence Classification. In this notebook, we will be exploring the concept of Embeddings, and using them for Sentence Classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concepts of Embeddings and Vector Similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use pre-trained Embeddings for Sentence Classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "So what really makes them different from something like One-Hot vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "What's special is that they have semantic meaning baked into them. This means you can model relationships between entities in text, which itself leads to a lot of fun applications. All modern architectures make use of Embeddings in some way.\n",

    "You can read more about them [here](https://aman.ai/primers/ai/word-vectors/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using *pretrained* Embeddings: this means that we will be using Embeddings that have already been trained on a large corpus of text. This is because training Embeddings from scratch is a very computationally expensive task, and we don't have the resources to do so. Fortunately, there were some good samaritans who have already done this for us, and we can use their publicly available Embeddings for our own tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This part will allow you to explore what Embeddings are. We will load in pretrained Embeddings here and examine some of their properties. If you're interested, feel free look up the [Word2Vec model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781): this is the model that was trained to give us the embeddings you will see below."
